# ADR 0001: Authentication System Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Hook0 requires a flexible, secure authentication system to support multiple authentication mechanisms for webhooks, including:
- OAuth2 (client credentials)
- Bearer tokens
- Basic authentication
- TLS/mTLS certificates
- Configurable at both application and subscription levels

## Decision
Implement a multi-provider authentication system with the following key characteristics:
1. Support multiple authentication types through a pluggable provider model
2. Enable application-level and subscription-level authentication configuration
3. Use AES-256-GCM encryption for secret storage
4. Provide two secret storage mechanisms:
   - Environment variable references
   - Encrypted database storage
5. Implement token caching and automatic refresh for OAuth2
6. Create comprehensive audit logging for all authentication attempts

## Consequences

### Positive
- Highly flexible authentication system
- Strong security with encryption at rest
- Support for complex authentication scenarios
- Minimal performance overhead with caching
- Comprehensive audit trail

### Negative
- Increased complexity compared to single-auth approach
- Additional database schema and encryption key management
- Potential performance impact of encryption operations

## Alternatives Considered
- External secret management services (rejected due to added complexity)
- Static configuration (rejected due to inflexibility)
- Single authentication type support (rejected due to diverse customer needs)
