# ADR 0003: Authentication Provider Design

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Hook0 needs to support multiple authentication mechanisms with a flexible, extensible architecture that allows easy addition of new authentication types.

## Decision
Implement an authentication provider system with the following characteristics:
1. Abstract `AuthenticationProvider` trait in Rust
2. Concrete implementations for:
   - OAuth2 (client credentials)
   - Bearer Token
   - Basic Authentication
   - TLS/mTLS Certificates
3. Provider-specific configuration
4. Unified authentication interface
5. Token caching for OAuth2
6. Automatic token refresh

## Consequences

### Positive
- Highly extensible authentication system
- Easy to add new authentication types
- Consistent interface across providers
- Efficient token management for OAuth2
- Flexible configuration at application/subscription level

### Negative
- Increased initial development complexity
- Potential performance overhead for token caching
- More complex testing requirements

## Provider Design Details
- Each provider implements `authenticate(&mut Request)` method
- Providers handle their specific authentication logic
- Centralized `AuthenticationService` coordinates provider selection and usage
- Lazy loading of authentication configurations

## Alternatives Considered
- Enum-based approach (rejected due to lack of extensibility)
- Separate microservices for each auth type (rejected due to unnecessary complexity)
- Hardcoded authentication methods (rejected due to inflexibility)

## Future Expansion
- Support for additional OAuth2 flows (authorization code, PKCE)
- Additional authentication providers
- More granular configuration options
