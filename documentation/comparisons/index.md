# Comparisons

Webhooks are a way for two applications to communicate with each other in real time. Instead of constantly polling for changes (which is inefficient), webhooks allow applications to be notified immediately when events occur.

The traditional implementation uses HTTP POST requests - applications provide URLs to receive JSON payloads when events happen.

Hook0 is a fully open-source project also available as a hosted service that makes it easy to set up and manage webhooks.
