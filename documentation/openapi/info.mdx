# Hook0 API Reference

Welcome to the Hook0 API reference documentation. This comprehensive guide provides detailed information about all available API endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods.

## Base URL

```
https://app.hook0.com/api/v1
```

For self-hosted instances, replace with your domain:
```
https://your-domain.com/api/v1
```

## Authentication

Hook0 uses **Biscuit tokens** for authentication. All API requests must include an `Authorization` header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer biscuit:YOUR_TOKEN
```

### Token Types

- **User Access Token**: For user-authenticated requests
- **Service Token**: For application-to-application communication
- **Refresh Token**: For obtaining new access tokens

## API Organization

The API is organized into the following sections:

### 🔐 Authentication
Endpoints for user authentication, token management, and password operations.

### 🏢 Organizations
Manage organizations, invitations, and member roles.

### 📱 Applications
Create and manage applications that send and receive webhooks.

### 📊 Event Types
Define the types of events your application can emit.

### 📤 Events
Send events and retrieve event history.

### 🔔 Subscriptions
Configure webhook subscriptions to receive events.

### 📈 Request Attempts
Monitor webhook delivery attempts and troubleshoot failures.

### 🔑 Service Tokens
Manage API tokens for programmatic access.

## Rate Limiting

API requests are rate-limited to ensure fair usage:

- **Global limit**: 2000 requests/second
- **Per-IP limit**: 200 requests/10ms
- **Per-token limit**: 20 requests/100ms

Rate limit headers are included in responses:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests allowed
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests remaining
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time when limit resets

## Error Handling

Hook0 API uses standard HTTP status codes:

- `200 OK`: Successful request
- `201 Created`: Resource created successfully
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request parameters
- `401 Unauthorized`: Missing or invalid authentication
- `403 Forbidden`: Insufficient permissions
- `404 Not Found`: Resource not found
- `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server error

Error responses include a JSON body:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Invalid request parameters",
    "details": {
      "field": "email",
      "reason": "Invalid email format"
    }
  }
}
```

## Pagination

List endpoints support pagination using query parameters:

- `limit`: Number of items per page (default: 20, max: 100)
- `offset`: Number of items to skip
- `sort`: Sort field and direction (e.g., `created_at:desc`)

Example:
```
GET /api/v1/events?limit=50&offset=100&sort=created_at:desc
```

## Webhooks

When subscribing to events, Hook0 will send webhooks with:

- **Signature verification**: HMAC-SHA256 signature in `X-Hook0-Signature` header
- **Retry logic**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- **Idempotency**: Event IDs ensure exactly-once delivery

## SDK Support

Official SDKs are available for:

- [JavaScript/TypeScript](../reference/sdk/javascript)
- [Rust](../reference/sdk/rust)
- Python (Coming soon)
- Go (Coming soon)

Each endpoint in this documentation includes an interactive "Try it out" feature. Simply:

1. Click the "Try it out" button
2. Enter your Biscuit token
3. Fill in the request parameters
4. Click "Execute" to send the request
