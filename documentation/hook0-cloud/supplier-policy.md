## Summary

This policy describes rules and principles on how we manage supplier relationships in our organization.

The service manager and office manager are responsible to implement the policy.

## Principles

- The contract should contain our requirements for information security
  - Access to data and conditions
  - Service level agreement
  - Compliance to relevant Policies
  - KPIs should be added to Suppliers
- If the supplier will process PII (personally identifiable information) on our behalf:
  - A data processing agreement (DPA) must be signed
  - The data should be located within the EU
  - There should have a privacy policy in which they adhere to GDPR
- Suppliers should be assessed periodically, taking into account
  - Performance (are we happy with them?)
  - KPI performance (are they living up to the expectations?)
  - Recent incidents (where they a party in a recent information security incident?)
