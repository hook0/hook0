## Summary

The mobile device policy defines rules and principles for the use of mobile devices, such as laptops, tablets and mobile phones.

The policy is applicable to all internal and external personnel.

## Principles

### Remote working

- You are not allowed to leave the laptop unattended in car or hotel unless properly secured, e.g. using a cable lock
- Be aware of people peeking over your shoulder. If this cannot be avoided, use a privacy screen

### Protection

- Only authorized repair shops may be used
- Unlock codes or passwords may not be shared  
  Remote device wipe is enabled

### Usage of own devices
