We use the following definitions of severity:

| Severity | Definition | Example |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **Sev 1 - Critical** | Critical impact/complete outage. Majority of users are impacted. There is no workaround. Customer's business is dramatically impacted. | Hook0 is inaccessible for all company applications. |
| **Sev 2 - High** | Severe impact or downgrade of services. Majority of users are impacted. A workaround may be available, but performance is degraded. | Large number of users can't access Hook0 services. |
| **Sev 3 - Normal** | Restricted impact, most of the system is functioning properly. Something is not functioning as expected. | An application, a subscription or subset of users are experiencing poor latency when using Hook0 API. |
| **Sev 4 - Low** | Low impact or informational request. Feature requests. | Product usability issues or use case inquiries. |

We know how important it is to resolve issues quickly, and that's why we make all reasonable efforts to meet or exceed the stated response and resolution times for issues within our scope of support.
