:::danger Development Only

This configuration is intended **for development and testing purposes only**, not for production use.

This setup does not address production concerns such as:
- **Scalability** - handling increased load and traffic
- **Resilience** - fault tolerance and recovery
- **High availability** - minimizing downtime
- **Observability** - monitoring, logging, and alerting
- **24/7 operations** - on-call support and incident management

For production workloads, use [Hook0 Cloud](https://www.hook0.com) which provides a fully managed, production-ready infrastructure.
