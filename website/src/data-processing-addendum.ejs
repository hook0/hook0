                    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">Data Protection Officer</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">Hook0's Data Protection Officer (DPO) is responsible for overseeing GDPR compliance:</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong class="text-white">Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:dpo@hook0.com">dpo@hook0.com</a></p>
                </div>

                <p>The purpose of this DPA is to reflect the parties' agreement with regard to the processing of Personal Data in accordance with the requirements of Data Protection Regulations.</p>

                <p>In respect of the processing of Personal Data of the Customer by Hook0 under the Terms of Services, the parties acknowledge that the Customer is the Data Controller and Hook0 is the Data Processor and both agree to comply with all corresponding obligations as per the Data Protection Regulations.</p>

                <p>The Customer gives instructions to Hook0 to process such Personal Data on its behalf as it is necessary for the purposes of the Terms of Services as defined in Appendix 1 "Description of Personal Data processing". The Appendix 1 is filled out by the Customer and shall be updated if any change is made by the Customer.</p>

                <h2>1. COMPLIANCE WITH DATA PROTECTION REGULATIONS</h2>

                <p>Each party shall comply with its obligations under the Data Protection Regulations.</p>

                <p>All capitalized words in the DPA shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the GDPR, the Data Protection Regulations and in the Terms of Services.</p>

                <h2>2. DATA PROCESSING OPERATIONS UNDER THE DPA</h2>

                <p>As a reminder, for every processing carried out under this DPA, the Customer shall:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Document the instructions related to Personal Data,</li>
                    <li>Provide the information related to the processing to fill the Appendix 1 by contacting Hook0 via the support email address: <a href="mailto:support@hook0.com">support@hook0.com</a>.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The Customer warrants to Hook0 that it is entitled to transfer the Personal Data to the Hook0 and/or the Sub-processor(s) in full compliance with Data Protection Regulations, including as needed, compliance to any prior required formalities and Data Subject rights, such as information and/or consent when such is required under Data Protection Regulations.</p>

                <p>The Customer acknowledges that it is and shall remain solely responsible for determining the purposes and the means of Hook0's processing the Personal Data. The Data Controller remains solely responsible for the accuracy and adequacy of the aforementioned instructions. Any changes to the instructions given or the security measures that are required by the Customer, including in order to comply with applicable data protection laws, shall be agreed by the parties and/or via an amendment to this DPA. Any costs incurred by Hook0 in complying with such changes shall be borne by the Customer.</p>

                <p>The Customer undertakes that the Data Subjects have been informed or will be informed before the transfer of their Personal Data to Hook0 in the scope of the Services.</p>

                <p>The Product is not intended to process Special Categories of Personal Data. Therefore, the Customer undertakes to prevent any processing of Special Categories of Personal Data through the Product and the Services. However, at the Customer request, processing of Special Categories of Personal Data may be performed by Hook0. In such case, the Processing shall be covered by a specific addendum to the DPA to be entered into between the Customer and Hook0.</p>

                <p>In case the Customer expressly requests the assistance of Hook0 for the fulfilment of its obligation under the Data Protection Regulations, then Hook0 shall address to the Customer the estimated costs for such assistance. Upon express acceptation of the estimated cost, Hook0 shall provide assistance pursuant to the instructions of the Customer and the terms of the present DPA.</p>

                <h2>3. SCOPE & INSTRUCTIONS</h2>

                <p>Hook0 undertakes to:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>solely process the Customer's Personal Data disclosed by the Customer as well as those collected or produced during the Terms of Services for the purpose(s) fulfilling its obligations under the Terms of Services and in compliance under the Customer's documented instructions, unless otherwise required by applicable Data Protection Regulations;</li>
                    <li>ensure that any person acting under its authority, who has access to the Customer's Personal Data disclosed by the Customer as well as those collected or produced during the Terms of Services, will process those data solely for the purpose of fulfilling Hook0's obligations under this Terms of Services and on instructions from the Customer, unless required by applicable Data Protection Regulations;</li>
                    <li>refrain from using Customer's Personal Data for any misappropriated, fraudulent or personal use, including for commercial purposes;</li>
                    <li>immediately inform the Customer if, in its opinion, a Customer's instruction infringes applicable Data Protection Regulations.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>4. COMMUNICATION OF CUSTOMER'S PERSONAL DATA TO THIRD PARTIES</h2>

                <p>The Customer's Personal Data processed under the DPA shall not be subject to any assignment, lease, concession, communication or disclosure to a third party, including sub-Processors of Hook0, except otherwise required by the Terms of Services or by a legal or regulatory mandatory provision.</p>

                <p>In such a case, Hook0 shall inform the Customer of that legal requirement before Processing, unless that legal or regulatory mandatory provision prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest.</p>

                <h2>5. SUB-PROCESSING</h2>

                <p>With respect to the conditions referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 of article 28 of GDPR for engaging another Data Processor (the "<strong>Sub-processor</strong>"), the Customer agrees that Hook0 may sub-process the Processing of the Customer's Personal Data.</p>

                <p>Notwithstanding the general consent given by the Customer, Hook0 shall inform the Customer of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of any Sub-processor within a reasonable time prior to implementation of such change. The list of the sub-Processors under the authority of Hook0 is available to the Customer at <a href="./gdpr-subprocessors.ejs">Hook0 / GDPR Sub-processors</a>.</p>

                <p>Where Hook0 engages a Sub-processor who shall process the Customer's Personal Data, the same data protection obligations as set out in the DPA shall be imposed on the Sub-processor by Hook0.</p>

                <p>This agreement must in particular provide for an obligation of the Sub-processor to provide sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that the Processing will meet the requirements of Data Protection Regulations and of the DPA.</p>

                <h2>6. TRANSFER OF CUSTOMER'S PERSONAL DATA OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA (EEA)</h2>

                <p>Hook0 warranties the Customer that the Customer's Personal Data are located in France or in the European Union. Hook0 undertakes not to carry out any transfer of Customer's Personal Data outside the EEA without the written consent of the Customer.</p>

                <p>At the request of the Customer and upon instructions, Hook0 shall store or transfer Personal Data to other Hook0 entities and/or to Sub-processors located in countries outside the EEA ("Third Countries"). In that case and when Third Countries have not been subject to an adequacy decision of the European Commission, Hook0 undertakes that the transfer will be carried out in accordance with the Data Protection Regulations and will be subject to appropriate safeguards to guarantee a level of protection equivalent to the one guaranteed by the Data Protection Regulations, such as the signing of the Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission and available at <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en">https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en</a>.</p>

                <p>The Customer hereby mandates Hook0 to sign on its behalf the Standard Contractual Clauses with Hook0 entities and sub-Processors located in Third Countries.</p>

                <p>At the request of the Customer, Hook0 agrees to assist the Customer to perform a transfer impact assessments to identify any gaps between the Data Protection Regulations and the laws of the Third Country and to implement the necessary supplementary measures to guarantee a level protection equivalent to the one guaranteed by the Data Protection Regulations.</p>

                <h2>7. SECURITY MEASURES AND CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE PROCESSING</h2>

                <p>Hook0 shall take, insofar as this is relevant to the provision of the Services or compliance with its other obligations in the DPA, adequate measures to ensure a level of security of the Customer's Personal Data appropriate to the risk and to take into account the principles of data protection by design and by default in the execution of the DPA.</p>

                <p>Hook0 undertakes to:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>implement all appropriate technical and organisational measures in order to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access to Personal Data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed and, in particular, all the measures mentioned in Appendix 2;</li>

                </ol>

                <h2>8. PERSONAL DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION</h2>

                <p>Hook0 shall notify the Customer of any Personal Data Breach without undue delay and in writing after it becomes aware of a Personal Data Breach. When the information is available to Hook0, such notification shall:</p>

                </ol>

                <h2>11. RETENTION, RETURN OR DESTRUCTION OF THE PERSONAL DATA</h2>

                <p>The Customer remains solely responsible for implementing and managing Personal Data retention periods, and undertakes to use the Product accordingly.</p>

                    <li>Certify the destruction of the Personal data in writing.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>12. DOCUMENTATION AND AUDIT</h2>
