                            These services are automation tools that help connect online services together. Hook0 is
                            a platform that gives your application the ability to send webhook events to your users
                            (who may use these services).

                            We've already built webhooks, can we still use Hook0?
                        </dt>

                            That is a great use case for using Hook0 since you've already validated that your
                            users want webhooks. There is a good chance that what Hook0 offers is much more robust
                            than your solution. If that is the case, then migrating your custom solution to Hook0
                            will allow you to <strong>focus</strong> on other priorities while offering a top notch
                            webhook solution.
