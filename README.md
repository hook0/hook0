# 🐰 Introduction
Hook0 is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing webhooks.

- **Free & open-source**. No artificial limitations, vendor lock-in, or hidden paywalls.
- **REST API**. JSON REST API and integrations makes it easy to trigger webhook events from your Application and connect to every available SaaS
- **Fine-grained subscriptions**. Enable your users to subscribe to your events by setting up a webhook. They can choose which event types they want to receive.
- **Auto-Retry**. If Hook0 can't reach a webhook, or if it does not respond with a success code, Hook0 will try again automatically.
- **Event scoping**. Scope events to one or several levels of your application.
- **Events & responses persistence**. Hook0 keep tracks of every event your application sent it and of every webhook call. Best for debugging !
- **On-Prem or Cloud**. Run locally, install on-premises, or use our self-service Cloud service (free tier available).
- **A modern dashboard**. Our dashboard app is safe and intuitive for non-technical users, no training required.
- **Project fully sustainable** since day 1. Fork it, twist it and help us build the best open source webhook server for applications
