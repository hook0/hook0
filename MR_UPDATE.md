## Build Fixes Applied

The following compilation errors have been resolved:

### Dependencies
- Added missing crate dependencies: `hmac`, `sha2`, and `tokio` features

### Code Fixes  
- Added recursion limit directive to resolve SQLx macro expansion issues
- Updated IAM action definitions to include required `application_id` fields
- Fixed `authorize_for_application` function calls with correct parameter count
- Replaced dynamic SQL query construction with static queries for SQLx compatibility
- Added missing match arms for operational webhook actions in `generate_facts`
- Fixed syntax error in Role's Serialize implementation

### Testing
All compilation errors have been resolved and the code now builds successfully. The implementation includes:

- Event generation system with automatic triggers
- Webhook delivery with HMAC-SHA256 signatures
- Exponential backoff retry logic
- Auto-disable after repeated failures

The system is ready for review and testing.
